                <p class="text-start">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance brought Raiden to the forefront of the Metal Gear universe once again in style, so it’s no wonder that fans of the original have been clamoring for a sequel for some time. It’s been a decade since we last wielded the HF Blade, and you would have expected the ten-year anniversary to be the perfect time to announce Metal Gear Rising 2. Unfortunately, February 19, 2023, came and went with nothing but some artwork from the original, and no mention of Metal Gear Rising 2.</p>
